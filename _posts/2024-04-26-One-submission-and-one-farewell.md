We are very happy to report that the first PhD thesis from the lab has been submitted this month!
With just one day to spare before the deadline (as it should be ðŸ˜…), Dilfuza has submitted her
thesis to the ZIB office. Now we wait for the public defense in June.

In other news, last month Adam has officially left the lab to take an exciting new job as a postdoc
in the lab of [Craig MacLean at the University of Oxford](https://macleanlab.wordpress.com/). Luckily Adam made a big push
before leaving and finished some large scale experiments thanks to his usual stamina, which will be
missed!

Congratulations to Dilfuza and Adam for these exciting news!
