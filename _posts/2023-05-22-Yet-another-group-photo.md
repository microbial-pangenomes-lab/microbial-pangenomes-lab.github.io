[As promised](/2023/04/28/Meet-the_lab/) it did not take two years to get another

This time we took advantage of a quick trip to WÃ¼rzburg to visit a collaborator.

**Update 2023/05/24**

Adam flexed his Photoshop muscles and created a nicer composite photo with everyone in it. Can you spot who was added after the fact?
