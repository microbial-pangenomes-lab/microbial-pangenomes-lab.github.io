  She has over 2 years of experience as a Laboratory Technician at the International Reference Hospital \
  in her hometown, Buea in Cameroon. She also served as chief of programs at an NGO she co-founded with \
  two close friends (Integrated Health Organization). Her passion for community health inspired her to \
  pursue the Erasmus Mundus joint masterâ€™s program in Infectious disease and One health. Where she had \
  the privilege of undertaking studies and research in three partnering universities across Europe: \
  Universite de Tours, France, Universidad Autonoma Barcelona, Spain and the University of Edinburgh \
