Our paper describing [the microGWAS pipeline]({{ site.url }}/2024/07/10/Making-microbial-GWAS-accessible-through-a-bit-of-plumbing/) was 
[published yesterday in the journal Microbial Genomics](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.001349).
We made lots of fixes and additions to the [code](https://github.com/microbial-pangenomes-lab/microGWAS)/[documentation](https://microgwas.readthedocs.io/)
since [the preprint version](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602456), including
[a hard to reproduce bug](https://github.com/microbial-pangenomes-lab/microGWAS/commit/58e176dbbf4060722625ef70a459252d450b2d9f) that only showed up in a specific HPC ðŸ¥µ

As you can see from the photo (taken by the [RESIST press office](https://www.resist-cluster.de/en/about-us/management/)) we were quite happy that the publication date coincided with the
[International Day of Women and Girls in Science](https://www.un.org/en/observances/women-and-girls-in-science-day)!
