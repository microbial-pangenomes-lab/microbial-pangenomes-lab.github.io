Last week Bamu successfully defended her PhD dissertation from the questions of her
two examiners: [Katharina Schaufler](https://www.helmholtz-hioh.de/de/forschung/people/person/prof-dr-katharina-schaufler/)
and [Marius Vital](https://www.mhh.de/en/institute-for-medical-mikcobiology-and-hospital-epidemiology/work-group-vital).

Congratulations to her for pulling this off as the first hybrid dry- and wet- lab PhD student to graduate from our lab!
