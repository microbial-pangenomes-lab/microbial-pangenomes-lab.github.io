We are very happy to report that the third and fourth PhD theses from the lab have been submitted last month!

This time we had a "tale of two theses"; Judit had her thesis 99% ready more than a week before the deadline (!),
while Hannes preferred to keep things interesting by having it ready just a day or so before it was due.
The steady flow of coffee and tea cups at his desk surely helped!

Regardless, we are all excited about their hard work and are now looking forward to the public defenses in June.

Congratulations to both!
