As anticipated [in the previous post]({{ site.url }}/2024/03/25/We-are-running-the-Hannover-half-marathon/),
we intended to run the Hannover half marathon, and indeed we did!

We all managed to get to the finish line, with a spetial mention to Hannes, who completed
the race in 01:59:52, with just 8 seconds to spare for the 2-hour psychological
barrier!

We didn't quite manage to get a photo on the day of the race, but we are happy to report
that we collected 366 Euros through [our DKFZ donation campaign](https://www.dkfz.de/de/spenden/InAktion/Eigene_Spendenaktion.html?the-microbial-pangenomes-lab-is-running-a-half-marathon-for-cancer-research). Thanks to all who donated!
