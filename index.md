## Welcome to the Microbial Pangenomes Lab

<br>
Our research is focused on microbial pangenomes. We are interested in understanding how genetic variants between bacterial strains relate to phenotypic variability, both generally and in the context of infection. Evolution of antimicrobial resistance and its dependency on microbial pangenomes is also a research area in the lab.

The lab is lead by [Marco Galardini](members/index.html#mgalardini); we are part of the [Molecular Bacteriology institute](https://www.twincore.de/en/research-groups/molecular-bacteriology/) at [Twincore](https://www.twincore.de/en/), as part of the [RESIST cluster of excellence](https://www.resist-cluster.de/en/), in Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany.

We are located at [Twincore](https://www.twincore.de/en/contact/), next to the [MHH](https://www.mhh.de/en/) campus. We also have a [page on Twincore's website](https://www.twincore.de/en/research-groups/molecular-bacteriology/rg-systems-biology-of-microbial-communities/).
