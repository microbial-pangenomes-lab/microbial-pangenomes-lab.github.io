We are very happy to report that the second PhD thesis from the lab has been submitted last week!
With a whole weekend to spare before the deadline (!), Bamu has submitted her
thesis to the ZIB office. Now we wait for the public defense in January.

Congratulations to Bamu for this hard-earned achievement!
