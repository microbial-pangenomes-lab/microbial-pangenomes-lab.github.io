We are hiring! We are looking for a postdoc to study
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) using high-throughput laboratory evolution
and genomics. Potential research topics include the influence of genetic
background on the evolution of AMR, dynamics of horizontal gene
transfer in microbial communities, and resistance to sequence-based therapeutics.
We are looking for a candidate with a PhD in molecular biology, microbiology or
evolutionary biology and with significant molecular biology experience.
Previous research in the area of antimicrobial resistance is optional, as well
as experience in liquid-handling platforms and basic computational biology.

We offer a contract with an initial period of 2 years with the possibility of
further extensions, and the opportunity to be trained in microbial genomics and
computational biology.
The lab is located in Hannover, an [affordable](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Germany&country2=Germany&city1=Berlin&city2=Hanover&tracking=getDispatchComparison)
