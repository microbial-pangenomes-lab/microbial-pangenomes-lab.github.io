Our lab (Hannes, Judit and Marco) is running the [Hannover half marathon](https://www.marathon-hannover.de/teilnehmer/allgemeine-infos/halbmarathon.html) on the 14th of April,
and we have decided that in order to boost our determination we needed support from colleagues, friends, and family.
And what better way to do it but to collect donations for a worthy cause? As researchers ourselves,
we have decided to support cancer research through [the DKFZ (the German Cancer Research Center)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Cancer_Research_Center).
Cancer is the second cause of death in Germany, [with an estimate ~270'000 deaths in 2019](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause?country=~DEU). Improved diagnostics and
therapeutics [have reduced the death rates from cancer since the 90s](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rate-who-mdb?country=USA~DEU), which clearly proves how a donation to cancer research has
the potential to affect the lives of many patients. So please help us get through the last two weeks of training and
through race day by supporting Cancer research! Follow the link below and scroll to the bottom of the page to find
the donation button. Thanks!

P.s. if you are having trouble getting through the payment system do get in touch with <a href= "mailto:galardini.marco@mh-hannover.de">Marco</a>, and he can make
the donation on your behalf and collect the monay afterwards through a bank transfer.
